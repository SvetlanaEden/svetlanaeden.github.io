For a person without experience creating his/her own website is extremely complicated. I would not have been able to do this without [**Michael Eden**](https://icanteden.com). He got me started by installing all of the necessary languages, by downloading the theme [**Karna Jekyll**](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/karna/) from the [**github**](https://github.com), and by patiently teaching me about everything related to the website design. 

I'd like to thank [**Lucy**](http://www.lucymcgowan.com/index.html) and [**Nick**](http://nickstrayer.me) for encouraging and enabling their fellow students to create their own websites.

Svetlana Eden, a resident of Nashville since 2003, has been drawing and painting guided by the teaching of [**Charles Brindley**](https://www.cbrindley.com/artist). She sees art as a means of self-expression and connection to people. She is passionate about images representing the places where she has lived, including Russia, Israel, and the U.S. Her artistic interests also include portraits and still life. She believes that in art, hard work and dedication are as important as talent and creative thinking. A biostatistician by trade, she also believes that a mathematically inclined mind combined with artistic expression can create powerful, complex, and emotionally engaging art. Her realistic style and interpretive content captivate your attention and take you on a journey of the subconscious.
