For a person without experience creating his/her own website is extremely complicated. I would not have been able to do this without [**Michael Eden**](https://icanteden.com). He got me started by installing all of the necessary languages, by downloading the theme [**Karna Jekyll**](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/karna/) from the [**github**](https://github.com), and by patiently teaching me about everything related to the website design. 

I'd like to thank [**Lucy**](http://www.lucymcgowan.com/index.html) and [**Nick**](http://nickstrayer.me) for encouraging and enabling their fellow students to create their own websites.
