For a person without experience creating his/her own website is extremely complicated. I would not have been able to do this without [**Michael Eden**](https://icanteden.com). His teaching, programming, and design skills have made this website possible.

I'd like to thank [**Lucy**](http://www.lucymcgowan.com/index.html) and [**Nick**](http://nickstrayer.me) for encouraging and enabling their fellow students to create their own websites.

This website is built using [**Karna Jekyll Themes**](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/karna/). I like this style because of the visual clarity: clicking on a button with a picture is somewhat more satisfying than clicking on a word.

And of course, what would we do without good old [**github**](https://github.com).
