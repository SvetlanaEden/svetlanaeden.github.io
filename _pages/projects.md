#### Snowflakes
Snowflakes have always seemed to me as some of the most beautiful objects. In order to be able to enjoy them in my work I wrote a very small R-package that generates _random snowflakes_. The images of the snowflakes can be used as plot symbols or for other purposes (art, crafts, ...). It is available on [**CRAN**](https://cran.r-project.org).

#### Earlier Projects
During my work as a staff biostatistician I did   [**several presentations**](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/Main/SvetlanaEdenRFiles) related to R-programming.
