Back in 2005, a friend of mine recommended to attend the art class of [**Charles Brindley**](http://www.cbrindley.com/home.html). I was lucky to give it a try. Charles often says "You have to give yourself a break, because if you don't you'll get so frustrated that you'll quit painting altogether..." Painting was so hard that at the beginning, it would be hard for me to enjoy it, and patience is the key. His other saying is: "You cannot rush these things...", probably meaning that painting should be less result-oriented and more process-oriented. I agree.
