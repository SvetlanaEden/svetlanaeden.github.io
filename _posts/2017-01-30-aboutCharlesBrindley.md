Back in 2005, a friend of mine recommended to attend the art class of [**Charles Brindley**](http://www.cbrindley.com/home.html). I consider myself lucky that I decided to give it a try. Charles has a lot of wisdom that he applies to painting, but it also works very well for other life experiences. One of the things he often says is: "You have to give yourself a break, because if you don't you'll get so frustrated that you'll quit painting altogether..." Painting is so hard, that until recently, I could not even enjoy the actual process. So this advice goes a long way.

His other saying is: "You cannot rush these things..." My understanding of this is that when you paint, you should be less result oriented and more process oriented. I tell this to myself all the time in other situations.
